# Solar-System-Higher-Lower-Shell
Simple shell-based higher-lower game for celestial bodies within our Solar System by pulling data through a public API, completed for my astronomy final project. Created back when I was less talented as a programmer.

The final project required us to create anything creative and fun that would enrich others' learning about astronomy. I wanted to focus mine on the Solar System and made a small shell-based game. There were no teammates, so I left it as a shell-based implementation. 
I recorded a very quick demo of the game for the class, and I received full marks (100%) and ended the course with an A+. Here is the YouTube demo link: https://youtu.be/W6oQsaBEX44.

This is an incredibly old program but I wanted to highlight my experience with Python. Nowadays, rather than big projects, I tend to use Python to code extremely quick scripts for my Cybersecurity CTFs.
The API I used was from the following URL: https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/.
